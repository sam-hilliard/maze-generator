A simple maze generator by Sam Hilliard. Implements Randomized Prim's
Algorithm in Java to create a maze displayed by the command line. Future versions
might use a GUI to display the maze. The maze's height and width will
be specified yb user input and will be completely randomized upon each
run. The generated maze will then be solved by another program, most likely.
