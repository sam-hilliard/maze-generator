A maze generator and solver GUI
By Sam Hilliard

This application creates a GUI for the user to automatically generate mazes
using the Depth-First-Search algorithm and solve mazes using the Breadth-
First-Search algorithm. A fairly simple interface involves two buttons allowing
the user to generate and solve mazes of a fixed size.
